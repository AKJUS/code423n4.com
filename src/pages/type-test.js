          Type Test - In which Pooh and Piglet Go Hunting and Nearly Catch a
          Woozle
        </h1>
        <p>
          The <small>Piglet</small> lived in a <strong>very grand house</strong>{" "}
          in the middle of a <code>beech-tree</code>, and the{" "}
          <em>beech-tree</em> was in the middle of the forest, and the Piglet
          lived in the middle of the house. Next to his house was a piece of
          broken board which had: <code>"TRESPASSERS W"</code> on it. When
          Christopher Robin asked the Piglet what it meant, he said it was his
          grandfather's name, and had been in the family for a long time,
          <a href="#jump">Christopher Robin</a> said you _couldn't_ be called
          Trespassers W, and Piglet said yes, you could, because his grandfather
          was, and it was short for Trespassers Will, which was short for
          Trespassers William. And his grandfather had had two names in case he
          lost one--Trespassers after an uncle, and William after Trespassers.

        <h2>"Well, there you are, that proves it," said Piglet.</h2>
        <p>
          One fine winter's day when Piglet was brushing away the snow in front
          of his house, he happened to look up, and there was Winnie-the-Pooh.
          Pooh was walking round and round in a circle, thinking of something
          else, and when Piglet called to him, he just went on walking.
        </p>
        <h2>"Hallo!" said Piglet, "what are _you_ doing?"</h2>
        <h3>"Hunting," said Pooh.</h3>
        <p>
          "Hunting what?" "Tracking something," said Winnie-the-Pooh very
          mysteriously. "Tracking what?" said Piglet, coming closer. "That's
          just what I ask myself. I ask myself, What?" "What do you think you'll
          answer?" "I shall have to wait until I catch up with it," said
          Winnie-the-Pooh.
        </p>
        <h4>"Now, look there." He pointed to the ground in front of him.</h4>
        <p>
          "What do you see there?" "Tracks," said Piglet. "Paw-marks." He gave a
          little squeak of excitement. "Oh, Pooh! Do you think it's a--a--a
          Woozle?" "It may be," said Pooh. "Sometimes it is, and sometimes it
          isn't. You never can tell with paw-marks." With these few words he
          went on tracking, and Piglet, after watching him for a minute or two,
          ran after him.
        </p>{" "}
        <h5>Winnie-the-Pooh had come to a sudden stop</h5>{" "}
        <p>
          And was bending over the tracks in a puzzled sort of way. "What's the
          matter?" asked Piglet. "It's a very funny thing," said Bear, "but
          there seem to be _two_ animals now. This--whatever-it-was--has been
          joined by another--whatever-it-is--and the two of them are now
          proceeding in company. Would you mind coming with me, Piglet, in case
          they turn out to be Hostile Animals?" Piglet scratched his ear in a
          nice sort of way, and said that he had nothing to do until Friday, and
          would be delighted to come, in case it really _was_ a Woozle. "You
          mean, in case it really is two Woozles," said Winnie-the-Pooh, and
          Piglet said that anyhow he had nothing to do until Friday.
        </p>
        <h6>So off they went together.</h6>
        <p>
          There was a small spinney of larch trees just here, and it seemed as
          if the two Woozles, if that is what they were, had been going round
          this spinney; so round this spinney went Pooh and Piglet after them;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Piglet passing the time by</li>
          <li>telling Pooh what his Grandfather Trespassers</li>
          <li>W had done to Remove Stiffness after Tracking</li>
          <li>and how his Grandfather Trespassers W had suffered</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          in his later years from Shortness of Breath, and other matters of
          interest, and Pooh wondering what a Grandfather was like, and if
          perhaps this was Two Grandfathers they were after now, and, if so,
          whether he would be allowed to take one home and keep it, and what
          Christopher Robin would say.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>And still the tracks went on in front of them....</li>
          <li>
            Suddenly Winnie-the-Pooh stopped, and pointed excitedly in front of
            him.
          </li>
          <li>"_Look!_" "_What?_" said Piglet, with a jump.</li>
          <li>
            And then, to show that he hadn't been frightened, he jumped up and
            down once or twice more in an exercising sort of way. "The tracks!"
            said Pooh. "_A third animal has joined the other two!_" "Pooh!"
            cried Piglet.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h1>
          "Do you think it is another Woozle?" "No," said Pooh, "because it
          makes different marks. It is either Two Woozles and one, as it might
          be, Wizzle, or Two, as it might be, Wizzles and one, if so it is,
          Woozle.
        </h1>
        <h2>
          Let us continue to follow them." So they went on, feeling just a
          little anxious now, in case the three animals in front of them were of
          Hostile Intent.
        </h2>
        <h3>
          And Piglet wished very much that his Grandfather T. W. were there,
          instead of elsewhere, and Pooh thought how nice it would be if they
          met Christopher Robin suddenly but quite accidentally, and only
          because he liked Christopher Robin so much.{" "}
        </h3>
        <h4>
          And then, all of a sudden, Winnie-the-Pooh stopped again, and licked
          the tip of his nose in a cooling manner, for he was feeling more hot
          and anxious than ever in his life before. _There were four animals in
          front of them!_ "Do you see, Piglet? Look at their tracks! Three, as
          it were, Woozles, and one, as it was, Wizzle. _Another Woozle has
          joined them!_"
        </h4>{" "}
        <h5>
          And so it seemed to be. There were the tracks; crossing over each
          other here, getting muddled up with each other there; but, quite
          plainly every now and then, the tracks of four sets of paws. "I
          _think_," said Piglet, when he had licked the tip of his nose too, and
          found that it brought very little comfort, "I _think_ that I have just
          remembered something.
        </h5>{" "}
        <h6>
          I have just remembered something that I forgot to do yesterday and
          shan't be able to do to-morrow. So I suppose I really ought to go back
          and do it now." "We'll do it this afternoon, and I'll come with you,"
          said Pooh. "It isn't the sort of thing you can do in the afternoon,"
          said Piglet quickly.

            "It's a very particular morning thing, that has to be done in the
            morning, and, if possible, between the hours of----What would you
            say the time was?"
          </pre>
        </code>
        <p id="jump">
          "About twelve," said Winnie-the-Pooh, looking at the sun. "Between, as
          I was saying, the hours of twelve and twelve five. So, really, dear
          old Pooh, if you'll excuse me----_What's that?_" Pooh looked up at the
          sky, and then, as he heard the whistle again, he looked up into the
          branches of a big oak-tree, and then he saw a friend of his. "It's
          Christopher Robin," he said. "Ah, then you'll be all right," said
          Piglet. "You'll be quite safe with _him_. Good-bye," and he trotted
          off home as quickly as he could, very glad to be Out of All Danger
          again. Christopher Robin came slowly down his tree. "Silly old Bear,"
          he said, "what _were_ you doing? First you went round the spinney
          twice by yourself, and then Piglet ran after you and you went round
          again together, and then you were just going round a fourth time----"
          "Wait a moment," said Winnie-the-Pooh, holding up his paw. He sat down
          and thought, in the most thoughtful way he could think. Then he fitted
          his paw into one of the Tracks ... and then he scratched his nose
          twice, and stood up. "Yes," said Winnie-the-Pooh. "I see now," said
          Winnie-the-Pooh. "I have been Foolish and Deluded," said he, "and I am
          a Bear of No Brain at All." "You're the Best Bear in All the World,"
          said Christopher Robin soothingly. "Am I?" said Pooh hopefully. And
          then he brightened up suddenly. "Anyhow," he said, "it is nearly
          Luncheon Time." So he went home for it.
